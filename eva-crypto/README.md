# eva-crypto

This crate aims at providing **prototype** level implementations of some encryption algorithms, which means it will expose the interfaces as most as possible based on the algorithm design.

## Supported Algorithms

- AES(-128, -192, -256)
- LED(-80, -128)
- PRESENT(-80, -128)
- SM4
- SKINNY(-64-64)
